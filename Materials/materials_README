Materials README file

This folder contains the study materials from the CogBIAS project (Booth et al., 2017, 2019) relevant to this project "Emotional information-processing correlates of positive mental health in adolescence: A network analysis approach" (Parsons, Songco, Booth, & Fox, 2020, submitted)

All task materials were programmed in Inquisit Millisecond 4 (available from https://www.millisecond.com/). The Mental Health Questionnaire (Keyes, 2009) was originally programmed as part of a wider questionnaire battery programmed in limesurvey - here we provide the .lsg limesurvey file, as well as a more accessible text file containing the questions.
