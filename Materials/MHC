MHC

The Mental Health Continuum - Short Form (MHQ-SF; Keyes, 2007) contains 14 items indending to capture positive mental health. We used a total score, but the scale can be separated into emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing. The scale has also been used to categorise participants as flourishing, languising, and moderate mental health (for full details of scoring, see Keyes, 2007).
